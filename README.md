Mnist Digit Recognition

   The objective of predicting handwritten digits is typically a classification task in the field of machine learning and computer vision. The goal is to develop algorithms that can accurately identify the digits (0 through 9) from images of handwritten digits. This task is often approached using supervised learning techniques, where a model is trained on a dataset of labeled images of handwritten digits. The model learns patterns and features from the training data and then generalizes its knowledge to correctly classify unseen handwritten digits.
